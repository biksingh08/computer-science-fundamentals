1) What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: John won a winning lottery ticket. Among John, there were thousands other
participants as well. The lottery inspector needs to search through every number
in his list of tickets bought to see which number is the wining number.

2) What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Going to the group where your last name is between certain letters at high school
counselor meetings. For example, someone with last name from S to Z would stand in that
line because he or she knows that his or her name is in that group.

3) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7 iterations

4) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3 Iterations

5) Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear search because the collection is unsorted and we want to go through every
item. Binary search won't work in this scenario.

6) Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary search because the time complexity will be O(logn) in which the input is halved.
This will be much faster than linear search which will be O(n) time complexity.

Programming questions

1) You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the
dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A:
function binaryFind(dictionary, word){
  var low = 0;
  var high = dictionary.length;
  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = Math.ceil((low + high) / 2);
    if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
    else if (dictionary[mid] < word){
      low = mid + 1;
    }
    else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return "Not Found";
  }  

2) You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted
goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A:
function netFish(fishArr, spotFish){
  var whiteSpotGoldFish = []
  for(var i = 0; i < fishArr.length; i++){
    if (fishArr[i] === spotFish){
        whiteSpotGoldFish.push(fishArr[i])
    }
  }
  return whiteSpotGoldFish;
}
