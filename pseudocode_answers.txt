1) Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Programmers use pseudocode to easily understand
the algorithms before transferring the pseudocode to a formal language.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: You would get error because computer won't understand it as it is not one of
the formal languages.


Programming Questions

1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

Function AddTwoNumbers(number1, number2)
  IF number1 is less than number2
  return number2
  ELSE
    return number1
  END IF
END Function

2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

Function PrintHundered
  For (SET a variable name equal to 1; SET the variable to less than and equal to 100; Increase the variable by 1)
    PRINT the variable
  END FOR
END Function

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Function SearchEntry(phonebook, entry)
  For (SET a variable named i equal to 0; SET i to less than the length of phonebook; increase i by 1)
    IF phonebook[i] = entry
    return phonebook[i]
    END IF
  END For
  Return "That entry does not exist in the phonebook"

END Function

3) Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any
computer language of your choice.

function oneHundered(){
  for(var i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    console.log(i);
  }
}
