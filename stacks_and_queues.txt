1) What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

A: Stack data structure means last in and first out. Queue data structure means
first in first out.

2) What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

A: They both require the objects to be stored in a data structure.

3) Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options
in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use
for each option and why?

A: UNDO is going to follow last in first out scenario so we will use stack
data structure. REDO is going to follow first in first out scenario, so we will use
queue data structure for that.

Programming questions

1) Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should
be converted to "!colB".

function reverseString(str){
  var strSplit = str.split('');
  var reversedStr = "";
    while (strSplit.length > 0){
      reversedStr += strSplit.pop();
    }
      return reversedStr;
  }

2) Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data
structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them
at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
   INIT stack;
   SET current to queue.dequeue;
   WHILE current is NOT undefined;
      push current to stack;
      SET current to queue.dequeue
   END WHILE
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS

3) Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as
expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   PUSH element to end of the list ;
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
    SET current to first element;
    DELETE current from the list;
    RETURN current;
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
